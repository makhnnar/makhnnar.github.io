# How I became software engineer

***A short story about how I face a lot of situations until came here where I am***

I started my college studies at the age of 19 years after taking a break of 6 months after high school, on Engineering of Electronics following the studies I did in automation and control in high school. Doing electronics was fun, joining all the semiconductors to make LED lights turn on and off, but in the middle I knew how to code in C++, and it was like magic. 

It was a complicated class in a completely new language. It was something wonderful to me and I have each time more and more interest in that thing called coding. Then, a number of things happened and I left Electronics in 3rd year to start from zero the career of Software Engineer.

It took me a while until I reached 2018 when I finished everything except for degree work. My dad died that year as well, and I started to work on a little software company as an android native developer. I found that works thanks to the recommendation of a dear teacher who I worked with as her consultant student teacher. It was basically like another teacher that helps the students to understand the topics of the class, in my case programming classes with C.

And later on, one, two, three years happened and my degree work wasn’t finished. Actually I started a second degree after finding that the first one was too greedy, and the COVID comes. At that time, 2022, almost 5 years later and I didn’t finish my career, but I had 5 years of experience as a software developer then.

It was tricky, because I have to leave the country, I need to continue to work, and the sensation that some day I’ll have my degree will start to become something unrealistic. At some point I almost gave up, because I lost contact with the teachers and the teacher that started the work with me left. As my work wasn’t ready to be presented, I found the help of an old work partner, who helps me to put the final details to the work and find a teacher that will support us to present the same. Finally, this year in May, I presented my degree work together with my friend and both became Software Engineers.  

This is a brief of what happened because all the persons involved to make this possible was huge. By myself it would be impossible. I could do it because my wife, my mom, my dad, my family, all the teachers, and my friends were there. If you are reading this, I would like to tell you thank you, for trusting in me. For those friends there in Venezuela, and for the new ones I have here in Brazil. For those people I see only on camera every day, and those ones I have the pleasure to drink a cup of coffee with. Thank you.

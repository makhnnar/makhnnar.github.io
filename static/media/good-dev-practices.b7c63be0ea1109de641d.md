# Good developer practices that don't involve how to code better but helps to it

***Things that I've learned over the years that can help you become a better sofware engineer.***

Keep learning and improving your skills as a developer is the normal advice that you will find about how to be a better professional in the tech industry and in any other industry, but there are other things you need to take care of and can have a lot of impact on your performance as a professional. 

## Eat well

This is something too obvious, because what you eat has a direct impact on your health, but also what you eat on which moments is something critical. For example, eating a nice cut of meat about 200 g would be a great experience if it is cooked by someone with the right skills, but eating that just before an important meeting will leave you with the desire to go to sleep. In fact, you need to avoid heavy meals, and take small portions with more frequency during your day.

This sounds simple, but is challenging, because remember that you are working, you need to focus your time on other important stuff, because eating well is an important stuff, then splitting your time to prepare more than 3 meals will be hard, trust me. You need to find your balance. Of course you can take the happy path and buy all your meals, but normally buying what you eat every time is not so healthy and of course could and would be expensive.

Eating could be complex if you don’t have the proper guidance, then please, go to a nutritionist, talk about your routine, and find with your specialist that point that allows you to eat well, delicious and easy. And of course, eat delicious meals, your day could change after a plate that you love, especially on those harder days.

## Train your body

Very obvious too, right? But apparently it is not. On social media you can see a lot of fit influencers talking about how to have a healthy life, and of course there is more knowledge about how beneficial is practice workouts, but we have a big portion of the global population being inactive, almost ⅓ of the global population is in that category in data you can find on the World Health Organization.

Sitting for long periods of time is killing us, that is a fact. Then, doing any kind of activity is more than welcome, to improve your life and your performance. Exercise improves brain plasticity, and that of course helps a lot when learning new things is something you need to improve your quality as a professional. 

The key with the exercise is not to run if you can’t walk. Be patient and kind with yourself. You don’t need to demonstrate anything to anyone, you need to improve your health, and that has to be your focus. Of course, having great bodies with a lot of muscles and a low fat is something beautiful and something to be proud of, but that is the consequence, not the goal, that is having quality of life that allows you to bring 200% at any moment.

## Sleep well

This is the easiest to agree because we can feel it very quickly in your body. Whoever who goes to parties and stays awake for longer periods of time, feels how desires to live leave the body second by second. The problem with this, is that our modern life has a lot of things that can disturb your sleep easily. Bad food, too much time on screens, constant notifications, alcohol, stress, and much more could be deadly swords threatening to kill your repair night. 

I’m not telling you that you need to be some kind of monk on the mountains to have the best sleep behaviour, but if your life is full of exes and abuse, your body will suffer it at some point and won’t be nice. Equilibrium is the best you can do here. Instead of taking 3 nights of parties without any sleep every week, take only until 2 or 3 am, one or twice a month. Make the time you are going to sacrifice for those moments really special, then if you are going to drink, drink the less you can and enjoy the alcohol by yourself and don’t let the alcohol enjoy by you.

About the stress, the best you can do is:

* Don’t blame yourself about things outside of your control  
* Don’t anticipate to something that is not happening  
* Be focused on the things you are doing avoiding multitasking.

You can be surprised about how many times of our day we spend on auto mode trying to be more and more productives, than listening to a podcast while you are doing something else is the must you have to do. That is unhealthy, and that is the reason why our attention is broken and fragmented, because we can’t focus for the fear of not being as productive as we can be. This idea that doing more is the best is killing the quality of our work and the quality of our life, filling us with the fear that we are not good enough. Take a break, breath and continue, don’t stop but be focused, and recognize that you are enough and have value.

## Talk with real people

In this modern world hyperconnected, every day we have on our hand devices that allow us to talk with anyone at any moment. You can be thousands of kilometers from your mother and you can send her messages, videos and photos about your exciting life in that country you dream of living in, but in a place you don’t know anyone. We feel more alone than ever. 

This is a total contradiction with this world that prices you with easy dopamine like smartphone notifications. We are losing contact with reality, and we are dying alone. Knowing new people, finding a partner, and making friends is harder than 20 years ago. This modern era is making us more unhappy, and the real relationships are disappearing. 

You need to go outside, that’s all. You need sun on your skin, but you need friends. It is healthy for your brain, it is healthy for your hearth, but at the end of the day it is healthy for your soul. I’m not going to lie to you, doing things remotely on the internet is nice and solves a lot of mobility problems, but that is not an excuse to not go outside and talk with your neighbor. You don’t know if that Hello is what is needed for that person who is thinking to drop everything for eternal sleep.

## Take a walk for your eyes

As we spend a lot of hours sitting in front of screens, our eyes that evolve to see things in the distance suffer a lot with this over-exposition. Then, if you want to avoid or reduce vision problems, walking outside during the sunlight and exposing your eyes to it at least for 90 mins, will reduce the stress on your retina, improving the health of your vision.  

But what can I do if I don’t have enough time during the day to take that kind of walk? In that case, every 30 min, take 3 or 5 mins, to see far distant objects. This will relax your eyes from watching closer objects like screens, avoiding eye fatigue after 8 hours of work.

## Fall in love with something and someone 

Fall in love, you need it. Romantic love is something beautiful, and deserves any effort you spend on it. Having things you love to do is marvelous as well, then imagine how magical it could be to do something you love with that special person to you. I know that today love seems to be more complex than before, but that doesn’t mean that it is impossible to achieve. 

With social media, it is easy to spend a lot of time doing nothing believing that you are doing a lot, but that is only a lie that the system creates to maintain your attention to make money for them. This is the main reason why people could be so unhappy and feel that they don't have a purpose, and why we overestimate the opinion of those that become successful images in this digital world. Dance no matter if you are good or bad at it, or try a new recipe because you can. Sing that special song to you, and dream about that world you want to build for your partner, your mother, your pets or children.

If you are reading until now, you could notice how each point is connected to the next and the others. Why will this make you more productive as a professional? Because you will be happier, healthier, and capable of focusing on what it matters. All this applies as well to other professional areas, and the only reason why I’m talking about Software Engineering is because it is my main expertise, but at the end of the day my message is simple: in order to be better we need to be happier.

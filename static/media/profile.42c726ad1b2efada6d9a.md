## SUMMARY

Software Engineering Manager that is still developing software as part of his daily basics. I have extensive experience solving problems and strong training in Mobile Development, and I’m currently leading a mixed mobile-backend-frontend team, and with them I’m delivering solutions for a project of a large scale. With over 8 years of experience in Android, I can develop new projects as well as legacy projects, maintaining them as well as creating new features. In addition to native Android, I also know other technologies such as Flutter, React, React Native and C\#, which makes me a full stack developer with important experience in developing mobile applications. I have proven ability to plan and design software using metrics and KPIs and agile development with SCRUM and KANBAN, as well as mentoring direct reports and leading projects to successful results. My knowledge of using DDD as a practice in product creation balances the code to be developed and the value that must be delivered to the customer. I can speak English, Spanish and Portuguese fluently, which makes me ideal for teams of multiple languages. Open to technical and managerial leadership roles.

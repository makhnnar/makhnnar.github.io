# Hiring process experiences

***Little thoughts about what I learn hiring people***

Hiring people is challenging, no secrets in that part, but on tech could be more difficult than you expect. There are a lot of variables you need to control in order to find that profile that fits with your team, taking care of the knowledge and the culture at the same time. Then I'm going to share with you what I learned in my experience hiring people in the recent years in the tech industry.

Live coding exercises are not good. Those kinds of filters that have in mind to select only the best profiles between a bunch of developers could be stressful or meaningless, because a candidate could fail for many different reasons like, pressure, internet connection broken and other ones. On the pressure section you need to think that real solutions come from creativity and the free space to solve problems, not from the hit of a belt in the back.

Ask the basics but be kind. It is important to understand if your candidate knows the basics, concepts that as developers they need to know, but remember at the same time the level of the same. Try not to blame someone for not knowing exactly what the Liskov substitution principle is when you tell it out loud. It is best to understand if they can apply those concepts instead of knowing them like a charm. Actually that is your work, determine if they have the skills, and because of that you need to guide the interview to catch if they know at least the how. 

Understand that technologies are not barriers. As we want someone that spends the less time learning about the tech stack, is normal to try to find that candidate that matches perfectly with the position, but sometimes that is not possible, then be open to someone that has the enough skills and seniority to learn new technologies quickly is best that find that perfect match that maybe is not a good fit on the cultural part. And yes, culture is more important than technology if you have space to learn and adapt.

Those insights are not bullet proven, and will depend on your specific context, then it is very important that you consider each case carefully understanding the complexity behind this task, avoiding to find short paths that can hurt you more than help you, because at the end of the day we are talking about people, then be gentle.
